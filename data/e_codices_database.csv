"Basel, Universitätsbibliothek, A VI 14",Paper · 147 ff. · 29 x 21.5 cm · Basel · 1466,"This volume contains a large number of texts about theology and canon law. All of it was written by one scribe, the Carthusian Heinrich von Vullenhoe of Basel. In a long note he provides information about the motives that guided him during the compilation: Since as a Carthusian he could not himself act as a preacher, he only had the possibility to spread the Word of God with his hands, i.e. by writing books. He expresses the hope that this compilation he has organized may strengthen the pious on their path and may offer an occasion for remorse for the sinners. Many of the texts that Vullenhoe has combined in this volume refer directly to the Carthusian Order.

The manuscript contains various texts: the Annals of Lausanne, a topographic cartulary, a chronological register, two chronicles, an urbarium, the Chronicle of the Bishops of Lausanne and the Cathedral's necrology.

Noteworthy is the fact that the biblical text shows signs of careful correction and that the psalms are divided into smaller sections according to a scheme, which rules out that it was commissioned by a monastery, but suggests instead that it was commissioned by a secular priest or a layperson. An erased note of ownership suggests that in 1338 this manuscript belonged to the Celestine Monastery Notre-Dame of Ternes (Limoges), perhaps a gift from its founder Roger le Fort, who was the son of the Lord of Ternes and was Archbishop of Bourges in 1343. Before this Bible became part of the collection of Martin Bodmer, it belonged to the collection of Baron Edmond de Rothschild (1845-1935), hence the name “Rothschild-Bibel.”               (ber)",https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/searchresult/list/one/fmb/cb-0187,"<iiif-image image-classes=""rounded loading-indicator-thumb preview-thumbnail"" image-file-path=""fmb/fmb-cb-0187/fmb-cb-0187_033r.jp2"" image-rel=""https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/loris/fmb/fmb-cb-0187/fmb-cb-0187_033r.jp2/full/pct:25/0/default/jpg"" image-server-base-url=""https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/loris"" image-size="",150"">

The Bhagavadgītā (""Song of the Lord"" - Viṣṇu/ Kṛṣṇa), which is a part of the Mahābhārata, book 6 from 18, is one of the most copied texts in the Hindu tradition, and this part of the Mahābhārata epic survives in a huge number of manuscripts. 3. (ff. 2_1r-2_107v) Copies of other parts of the Mahābhārata, Śāntiparvaṇ, which all are related to Viṣṇu. 4. (ff. 3_1r-6_31v) 2 parts of Pāñcarātrika Sanatkumārasaṃhitā, dealing with the praise of Viṣṇu, plus mantras including (ff. 4_1r-4_21r) Pāṇḍavagītāstotra, (ff. 5_1r-5_20v) Gopālapaṭala, (ff. 6_1r-6_23r) Gopālalaghupaddhati and other texts. 5. (ff. 7_1r-7_37v) Parts of the tantras, a. Saṃmohanatantra, dealing with the praise of Viṣṇu, i.e. Gopālasahasranāmastrotra; b. Gautamītantra, the part called Gopālastavarāja. 6. (ff. 8_1r-10_8r) Two different texts: 1. Niṃbarkakavaca, which is a production of the Nimbarka worship lineage of Vaiṣṇavas. 2. Part of ritual texts of Sāmaveda, dealing with the 5 saṃskāras, plus various vedic mantras, such as Gāyatrī, in its vaiṣṇava forms. 7. (ff. 11_1r-11_11v) Part of the Bhaviṣyotarapurāṇa dealing with the worship of the stones related to Viṣṇu from the Gaṇḍakī river (common name is shaligram). The manuscript contains 3 illuminated titles and 12 miniatures, most of which depict Kṛṣṇa.

"Cologny, Fondation Martin Bodmer, B-24.1","Paper · 2 pp. · 23 x 19 cm · n.d. [Paris, around January 1797]","The comedy The Mad Day, or The Marriage of Figaro is a vivid satire of society during the Ancien Régime and of aristocratic privileges; it was first performed on April 27, 1784 and presaged the beginning of the French Revolution, which it doubtlessly helped bring about. After the fall of the monarchy in 1792, the comedy was again performed on several Parisian stages, albeit the concluding songs were modified by Beaumarchais. The final stanza of the stuttering judge Don Gusman Brid'oison, which in 1784 had concluded Tout fini-it par des chansons, was adapted to the difficulties of the period: Pour tromper sa maladie, / Il [the people] chantoit tout l'opera : / Dame ! il n'sait plus qu'ce p'tit air-là : / Ca ira, ça ira... However, after the fall of Robespierre and the Thermidorian Reaction, these words roiled young Muscadins just as the previous ones had caused the Sansculottes to react. Since the performances were disrupted by such turbulent audiences, Beaumarchais entrusted La Rochelle, the actor who performed the role of Brid'Oison, with an alternative ending that could be recited en cas de bruit (in case of noise). This variant, which remained unpublished until recently, was a praise of freedom of speech and of the sang froid de la raison (the cold blood of reason) against the stratagème (wiles) of ideological cabals.

ceremony and was presented to the cardinal and archbishop on 19 March 1823. This mass in D major seeks to express and communicate, in

Later know by the title Le Chant de la Courtisane, this prose poem in a humorous tone was not published by Flaubert himself.

The manuscript is in a folder on which Flaubert noted the work's title as well as a date, 1857, that corresponds with the beginning of the writing of Salammbô. This chapter, however, was written after 1857: it was actually conceived after an important documentation phase indispensable to the project and after a trip to Carthage. Upon his return in 1858, the writer worked on a chapter that would be “the topographical and picturesque description of the aforementioned city, with a portrayal of the people who inhabited it, including the traditional costume, government, religion, finances and commerce, etc."" (Letter to J.

Hugo movingly denounces the condition of prostitutes: he actually invites the reader to sympathize with rather than despise the “fallen women”. This symbolic vocabulary, usually denoting moral depravity, is used here not to convey a fault, but to express the courage of women who long struggled against the inevitability of the burden of misery before succumbing to it. Far from a moralizing Manicheism, Hugo assigns faults generally attributed to these women also to “à toi, riche ! à ton or”, pointing a finger at the injustice of a social system lacking any distribution of wealth as well as “à nous”, each citizen whose regard is not charitable enough. This manuscript presents a slight variation of the printed text since it reads: “s'y retenir longtemps de leurs mains épuisées” instead of “s'y cramponner longtemps”.

Thus he extends to the spouse the criticism of Napoleon III that he had already presented in the Châtiments.

Rimbaud had planned to rework it. The numbering suggests that these three

"Cologny, Fondation Martin Bodmer, R-49.2",Paper · 38 pp. · 27.5 x 18.5 cm · December 1740,"The Mémoire présenté à M. de Mably sur l'éducation de M. son fils is Rousseau's first writing related to his experience as an educator. In 1740 he took up a difficult position as tutor in the family of the notable Jean Bonnot de Mably, provost general of police in the Lyon region. This position came to an end after only one year. Two young children with little inclination to study had been entrusted to his care: François-Paul-Marie Bonnot de Mably, called Monsieur de Sainte-Marie, five and a half years old, and Jean-Antoine Bonnot de Mably, called Monsieur de Condillac, four and a half years old. The long Mémoire, dedicated to the older boy, emphasizes the “educational mission” and experience with practical education: it is presented as a plan and a synthesis; its writing has been dated around December 1740. The young tutor addresses M. de Mably and makes known to him the plan and structure for the education of his son in order to shape “the heart, the judgment and the spirit.” This is not the natural education, which later on will be advocated in 'Émile. Did Rousseau really present this Mémoire to M. de Mably? Known is only that he gave this manuscript of the Mémoire to Mme Dupin, his employer in 1743, and that since then it has been kept with the “Papers of Mme Dupin.” It was published for the first time in Paris in 1884 by G. de Villeneuve-Guibert in Le portefeuille de Madame Dupin. The Fondation Bodmer's manuscript is the only one in existence. A Projet d'éducation, much shorter, more clearly structured and of unknown date, was found among Rousseau's papers at the time of his death (this manuscript, now lost, was first published in Geneva in 1782). It is very similar to the Mémoire and seems to have been written               (brc)",https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/searchresult/list/one/fmb/ms-Rousseau-R-049-002,"<iiif-image image-classes=""rounded loading-indicator-thumb preview-thumbnail"" image-file-path=""fmb/fmb-ms-Rousseau-R-049-002/fmb-ms-Rousseau-R-049-002_001.jp2"" image-rel=""https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/loris/fmb/fmb-ms-Rousseau-R-049-002/fmb-ms-Rousseau-R-049-002_001.jp2/full/pct:25/0/default/jpg"" image-server-base-url=""https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/loris"" image-size="",150"">

[Ferrara, 1576]","This ""paperolle"" from the famous ""Code Gonzague"" (held in the Biblioteca Ariostea of Ferrara) is a working copy for a passage that was added to Tasso's great work, completed the previous year. The poet had submitted his original work to various humanists and high-ranking scholars, and he took into consideration certain critiques and suggestions when editing his verses during the summer of 1576. Several stanzas were profoundly revised or even completely rewritten. Stanza 42 was one of the most reworked, to the point that Tasso had to paste this small strip of paper with the definitive version of the text into the manuscript. The text describes the attitude and thoughts of the Muslim princess Armide, who gets ready to harangue the caliph and his armies and incite them to fight to the death with the crusaders and thus to take revenge on the Christian hero Rinaldo, who had abandoned her.

This story of a conversion is more than an authentic Christian legend (then attributed to Saint John of Damascus) — it is above all a Christianized story. In the prince, who first gives up his palace in order to learn about the plagues of the world and then leaves his throne for the meditative life of an ascetic, one certainly recognizes Buddha. The edifying Christian story, set at the banks of the Ganges, is nothing other than an adaptation of Vie du Bodhisattva, a 2nd-4th century Sanskrit text, which over centuries was translated and adapted first by the Manichaeans, then by the Arabs, Georgians and Byzantines, until it finally reached the far distant people of the Western World: Lope de Vega's work thus (without the author's having been aware of this) is part of one of the  most impressive chains of intellectual transmission in history.

In addition to the life of Benedict following Gregory's Dialogi, in a unique translation that seems to exist only in this codex (according to Werner Williams-Krapp), the manuscript contains translations of three more legends of 13th century Dominican saints. These as well are attested only in this codex, have practically never been studied, and have not even been edited. First there is one of three versions of the translation of the Vita S. Dominici by Dietrich of Apolda; then there is the translation of Thomas Agno de Lentino's Legenda maior about the Inquisitor Peter of Milan (also know as Peter Martyr or Peter of Verona), who was killed in 1252; attached to this is the bull of his canonization issued by Pope Innocent IV in 1253. It is noteworthy that the translation of the bull also contains a legend of Peter which, according to Regina D. Schiewer, is independent of the one by Thomas Agno. If the translations of these legends into Alemannic that are contained in Cod. 671 were in fact created around 1300, as assumed by Schwierer, then the (abbreviated?) version of the translation of the life of Dominic contained in Cod. 671 would constitute the earliest proof of the presence of the revelations of Mechthild of Magdeburg in Southwestern Germany, as the final chapter of the fifth book of the life of Dominic (cf. fol. 80v-82r) is based on excerpts from the Latin translation of Das Fließende Licht der Gottheit.

The manuscript was donated to the Oratory by the Varesi family, possibly for this occasion, in order to allow the celebration of the Holy Mass. A quire containing the mass for the patron saint St. Bernardino (20-25) was added to the first quires (1-12, 16-19), as well as the loose leaf with two miniatures representing the Maiestas domini and the crucifixion.

The cover was inscribed by Antonia Bögin or Botzin (archivist, † 1763) from Kaufbeuren as follows: Lebensbeschreibung viler in allhiessigem gottshauss heylig-mässig gelebter closter-jungfrawen. The table of contents on the front pastedown, the chapter headings with the names of the St. Katharinental nuns mentioned in the book, and an enumeration of the nuns' vitae in the margins of the sheets are in a later hand. The two-column manuscript was written by two different hands. The main hand (pp. 1a-144a) wrote the lives of the nuns and a prayer. Another prayer (pp. 144b-154a) was written by the second hand. The parchment binding with fastening straps dates from the 18th century. The front flyleaf also contains a note of ownership: diss buoch ist schwester Margreten von Ulm († 1583) closterfrow in Sankt Kattrinen thal by Diessenhofen.

Individual initials are not only highlighted in red, but are also decorated. The manuscript has a raspberry-red leather binding with clasps, which was restored in the 20th century.

"Frauenfeld, Kantonsbibliothek Thurgau, Y 235",Paper · A + 190 + Z ff. · 30.5 x 22.5 cm · Ittingen? · 1490,This late 15th century manuscript is one of the earliest works in the holdings of the Carthusian Library in Ittingen. Jacobus Saurer von Blaubeuren (died 1514) is considered the scribe of the manuscript (with the exception of ff. 179r-180v): […] Jacobum Sënger alias Säurer propria ipsius manu conscriptus. The two-column paper manuscript contains the Tractatus super epistolas dominicales by the French scholastic Johannes Algrinus de Abbatisvilla as well as his entries on the Gospels for Pentecost. The text is written very evenly in a careful “Kurrent”. The brown wood-leather binding with clasps is contemporary and features decorative lines and ornamental stamps (stars and leaf ornaments).

The owner of the manuscript is Niklaus Hass (Primissarius in Allenbach): Iste liber pertinent Nicolao Hass primissario in Allenspach (f. 1r). This paper manuscript probably came to Kreuzlingen because of the good relations of Kreuzlingen Abbey to chapter of Constance. The two-column breviary was written by six different hands, of which that of Nikolaus Marschalk (died 1448, custos and canon of the monastery of St. Johann in Constance, see entry on f. 1r) can be named as the main hand (ff. 33ra-287vb, 290ra-303ra, 310ra-340rb and 342r). A second hand is responsible for the calendar and the beginning of the breviary (ff. 1r-8r, 12r-28vb and 309r-309v). Further entries are by four additional hands (third hand: ff. 28vb-32ra, fourth hand: ff. 288r-289v, fifth hand: ff. 303ra-304rb, sixth hand: ff. 305ra-308rb). The manuscript was written in a “Kurrent”. The contemporary wood-leather binding with a clasp and brass bosses is striking.

annal that records the celebrations for the anniversaries of the clergy of the
Cathedral of Lausanne – cf. the unnumbered title page:
Iste liber est capellanorum celebrancium in ecclesia katedrali
Lausannensi de anniversariis que fiunt per dictos celebrantes. The original part might be from the 1420s, to
which numerous later hands added on, in order to complete the anniversary
masses that were celebrated. The internal organization follows the calendar
month by month. The annal thus begins on January 1st (on page 1) and ends on
December 24th (on page 167). Each page consists of two columns, each
representing a different day, the title of which (letter – sometimes followed
by the name of the liturgical
feast) is rubricated.
At the top of each column, the days are also given as days of the month (in
Roman numerals) in a Gothic cursive script that seems to have been a later
addition. The older necrologies of the cathedral chapter of Lausanne are known
only through excerpts (included in the Lausanne cartulary at the behest of Conon d'Estavayer in 1224 and 1238) or mentions (in 1354 the chapter
delegates were mandated to write an “anniversary book” – which, however, disappeared).
This necrology was kept in Fribourg, probably arriving there after the conquest
of Vaud by Bern in the course of the Reformation; it is therefore the oldest
necrology surviving from the medieval period and makes it possible to fill in certain
documentary gaps.

The first two of these registers are the most important ones; they cover the period from 1341 to 1769 and are presented here in digitized form. The registers present the citizens of the city of Fribourg as they change from a citizenry that is very open for economic reasons at the turn of the 15th century to one that gradually closes itself off and then becomes a privileged patriciate in the 18th century. ‘Bürgerbücher' were a means of controlling the enrollment of new citizens through lists, which from the very beginning could be in book form.

Peter Schneuwly (1540-1597) can be considered the author; he himself probably went to school in Fribourg. From 1557 on, he studied in Freiburg im Breisgau, where he attained a Magister artium. From 1564 on, he was a member of the clergy of the Collegiate Church of St. Nicholas in Fribourg, in 1565 he became a canon, and in 1566 a preacher in the city. At this time, the first preparatory works for the “Katharinenbuch” took shape. In the years 1577-1597, Schneuwly was vicar general of the Diocese of Lausanne, from 1578-1587 also provost of St. Nicholas. The “Katharinenbuch” also constitutes the charter of the “Scholarchenkammer” (chamber of scholarchs) of the city of Fribourg, in whose possession it remained until the 19th century. The school reform sought by Schneuwly never went into effect because in 1580, also on Schneuwly's initiative, the Jesuits were called to Fribourg and were entrusted with secondary education.

The star-shaped rhumb lines with wind roses indicate the compass directions, while the scales, here marked in the corners of the leaves, make it possible to estimate distances. The precise course of the coasts highlighted with color and the elegant script of the toponyms are characteristic of maps from the Benincasa studio, which were intended as objects for book lovers, but not for navigation. Among the numerous inscriptions on these maps, those on the Atlantic islands are the most surprising, as they seem to anticipate the discovery of the American archipelago like “Antilia,” or the island of “Brazil”; these names were adopted by Christopher Columbus and his successors to name certain territories in the New World.

As a general of the Order of the Hieronymites (since 1457), but also as a close confidant and adviser of King Henry IV of Castile (1454-1474), Alonso advocated a tolerant attitude towards converted Jews. In 1450, he began writing the 'Lumen ad revelationem gentium et gloria plebis Dei Israel' - De unitate fidei et de concordia et pacifica equalitate fidelium (f. 1-203, Tabula 204-207); in 1465, he dedicated the completed book of 52 chapters to the Archbishop Alfonso Carrillo of Toledo (1410-1485). The announced second part of the work apparently was never written.In 1979, Luis A. Diaz y Diaz prepared a Spanish translation based on the three manuscripts then known. The present manuscript has not yet been acknowledged in research; it thus constitutes the fourth manuscript known so far.

first liturgical library of the nuns of Fille-Dieu, which today is dispersed
across all of Europe, has great significance for the history of the Cistercian
Order. The booklet FiD 1 (French musical notation) contains the oldest offices of St. Bernard and of the
Trinity, which were introduced into the order in 1175 or shortly thereafter.
The flyleaves are remarkable as well. Together with FiD 2, they represent
relics of antiphonaries that were copied around 1136/1140 and contain the
original Cistercian liturgy, which was copied shortly after 1108 in Metz by
monks sent by Abbot Stephen Harding. This liturgy was corrected within the
framework of the reforms of Bernard of Clairvaux. The existence of Bernardine
drafts had until now been known through antiphonary 12A-B from Westmalle Abbey
(Belgium) and through the one from Tamié Abbey 6 (Savoy). Codicological
analysis of the flyleaves of FiD 1 and of the fragments of FiD 2 reveals that
all pieces come from the Swiss Abbey of Fille-Dieu; they share identical status
and common characteristics, irrespective of current holding sites. The same
hands and correcting hands can be recognized, the same types of ornamentation
and the same later touch-ups, which were done at the earliest in the 16th
century, probably by the nuns or by the monks of Hautcrêt Abbey (Oron, VD),

Doubtlessly the parchment pieces of various sizes were glued together by the nuns of Fille-Dieu in order to cover a now lost liturgical formulary. Together, FiD 1 and FiD 2 constitute relics of antiphonaries that contained the primitive Cistercian liturgy. This was defined by Fr. Kovacs (“Fragments du chant cistercien primitif“, ASOC 6 [1950], pp. 140–150) and Chr. Waddell (The Primitive Cistercian Breviary, Fribourg, 2007 [Spicilegium Friburgense 44]) as the liturgy reformed by Stephen Harding shortly after 1108. During this reform, the abbot of Cîteaux forced the order to adopt the antiphonary of Metz, which was in use by the order until the time of the second reform under Bernard of Clairvaux.

According to the analysis of the calendar, this copy could date back to the middle of the 13th century, between 1246 (mention of Saint Lambert by the first hand, f. 100r) and 1255 (no mention of the mass for Saint Dominic on August 5th, f. 95r). Contrary to what is suggested by the labels (back and inside cover), this codex was copied before the end of the 1260s, since the mass of Saint Anthony (f. 75v) was noted by a second hand. In addition, f. 98v contains no mention of an octave of St. Bernard, which is usually included in all Cistercian books from 1295 on. A study of the musical and liturgical content shows that manuscript FiD 5, which is a faithful copy of the older Gradual of the order (Abbazia Tre Fontane 47, around 1140/1143), probably originated in Hautcrêt Abbey (Oron VD), which was the motherhouse of Fille-Dieu until 1536.

The vow Ego soror ill. promitto (f. 24v) could indicate that it was meant for Fille-Dieu. However, elsewhere the book contains rubrics and prayers that are written in masculine form by the original hand, and which are adapted to the feminine form through interlinear annotations by a hand contemporaneous with the book (f. 20r, 27v, 30v-39v).

Here the entrepreneur and metallurgist Fischer from Schaffhausen describes his encounters with Archduke John of Austria (1782-1859), which took place between 4 February 1826 [p. 1] and 25 June 1842 [p. 125]. The travel journals themselves, from which these excepts were taken, have not survived. After Archduke John had read Johann Fischer's English travel journals, he wished to get to know the author personally and sent Johann Conrad Fischer an invitation through Fischer's son [p. 3]. After the first meeting in February 1826, six more meetings occurred in the space of five years: 13 September 1826 [p. 15], 24. June 1827 [p. 21], 5 October 1828 [p. 50], 17 September 1829 [p. 58], 18 September 1829 [p. 77] and 17 September 1830 [p. 87]. After a hiatus of ten years, there were three last meetings: 25 June 1840 [p. 101], 24 June 1842 [p. 124] and 25 June 1842 [p. 125]. On 136 pages Fischer essentially recaps the conversations between the two men. These accounts allow us to understand Fischer's commercial interests and his activities in Austria. The content of the conversations as well as the circumstances of his visits afford us a glimpse of their common world in the context of the tensions between Switzerland and Austria, between old political orders and economic modernization. The entries are in chronological order and are followed by fourteen blank pages at the end. The page numbering is from when the album was created.

"Schaffhausen, Stadtbibliothek, Gen. 26",Paper · 182 ff. · 21.5 x 15.5 cm · Southwestern Germany · last quarter of the 15th century,"This manuscript of 182 leaves can be dated to the last quarter of the 15th century and can be placed in the area between Ulm and Memmingen (linguistically Swabian). The binding, made of wooden boards covered in leather and featuring a clasp, was made by a bookbinder who was active in Memmingen. The three treatises in the manuscript are from the field of pharmacology/medical science: the “Büchlein der Ordnung der Pestilenz” (2r-47v) by Heinrich Steinhöwel, the Ulmer Wundarznei (50r-144r) and “Von den gebrannten Wässern” by Michael Puff (147r-179v). The text is augmented with drawings of instruments (96v, 97r, 98v, 99r, 148v). Magnus Bengger (who names himself on 179v) should be considered the scribe; he also copied manuscript Schaffhausen Gen. 9, which likewise contains medical works. He uses a cursiva libraria. In several places, drolleries in the shape of faces spread from individual letters, always in the first line (e.g., 45v, 50r). The chapter titles, the (decorated) initials at the beginning of a chapter, dots at half-height, as well as individual, usually Latin words in the text generally are rubricated. Sentence-initial lexemes, however, are marked by Lombard initials in red. In keeping with the character of a medical housebook, to which one can add one's own recipes, there are additions by four other hands (mostly between or after the treatises, such as 48r, 145r, 180r).

Because these occur in large numbers, the text is not easily readable or understandable. Further evidence that the manuscript is rooted in alchemy comes from the fact that Coene refers to Paracelsus (1493/94-1541), e.g., in the short final chapter with the title “Che cosa il Balsamo Samech di Paracelso” (pp. 101-102). Coene also mentions the “Testamentum” (pp. 99-100) and names Raimundus Lullus (1232/33-1315/16) as its author; today it is considered a pseudo-Llull text. — Within the chapters, individual paragraphs are numbered, but in the last quarter of the manuscript this numbering seems to have been added later (pp. 81-102).

"Schlatt, Eisenbibliothek, Mss 38",Paper · 1 + 444 + 1 pp. · 17 x 11 cm · 1526,"The author of this manuscript gives his name at the outset (p. 3): Wok Pňovsky von Eulenberg (Czech: Vok Pňovický ze Sovince) comes from the Moravian noble family von Eulenberg (Czech: ze Sovince), whose coat of arms is depicted in the manuscript (p. 130). Wok is documented between 1499-1531; from 1518-1525 he held the position of chief justice of Moravia. In 1526 with this manuscript he produced an early exemplar of a “Probierbuch” (assay book), which treats several procedures for analyzing and further processing various ores and metals. The first part of the manuscript is divided into 40 chapters (pp. 4-130); in the second part of the manuscript, the sections are not numbered (pp. 133-420). Added at the end is a later (17th century?) table of contents (pp. 429-444), which offers short summaries of the chapters. Assaying was of great importance to the practice of early modern mining and metallurgy. Near Eulenburg castle (Czech: hrad Sovinec), the ancestral home of the family in Northern Moravia, Wok himself was engaged in the mining of precious metals (Papajík 2005, pp. 198-200). In Wok, therefore, the mining entrepreneur and the assayer coincided in one person. Before 1924 the manuscript was part of the holdings of the library of the museum of the ‘Gymnasium' or preparatory school (Czech: Knihovna gymnazijního muzea) in Troppau (Czech: Opava), a predecessor institution of the present library of the Silesian Museum (Czech: Knihovna Slezského zemského muzea). The manuscript has been lost since 1924. After a devastating fire in the spring of 1945, in which all accession books were destroyed, no documentation about the manuscript exists in the museum library today (information from 07-16-2015). David Papajík summarizes the current state of Czech research: “Vok also addresses theoretical aspects of mining. In 1526 he authored an extensive German language work of 420 pages on the topic, which, while it survived until the recent past and was held in the library of the museum of Opava, it was lost by 1924. We only know a description from 1881, produced by Josef Zukal. It is a great pity that this unique document about the understanding of mining of that time, has not survived into the present” (Papajík 2005, p. 200). The above-mentioned description from 1881 offers the following additional information “«Ms. chart. sec. XVI. Kl. Oct. bound in black leather without decoration, 420 pages […]. Mining flourished in the area of Eulenburg in the 15th and 16th century; thus the present work owes its creation to practical need. Without doubt it is Wok's original manuscript and offers an interesting insight into the state of metallurgy of the time. The index in a different hand was added at a much later time; this fact as well as the great wear indicate that the book was in use for a long time (Zukal 1881, p. 15 f.).

Seven illustrations are two-sided, one of them has a fold-out page. All texts in this manuscript are in Russian and in Cyrillic script. — The bridge was designed by Charles Baird (1766–1843), a Scottish engineer who had set up a business for metal casting, machine construction and shipbuilding in St. Petersburg and who had built a cast-iron bridge nearby in 1805/06. The manuscript's bridge project, however, calls for a combination of a floating bridge and a drawbridge: the floating bridge, resting on pontoons, splits into two branches, which end in two drawbridges near the shore (fol. 4a-5), so that it is possible to cross the bridge even while a ship passes beneath it. Other panels show, for example, the lifting mechanism hidden in the pillars (fol. 14a, 16, 17) and one of the boat-like pontoons anchored in the bed of the Neva River (fol. 20a-21). – The manuscript was purchased in Copenhagen in 1978.

According to Jean Graven, a leading expert on ancient law, these statutes are “par leur valeur intrinsèque et par leur aspect, la pièce royale, l'honneur et le couronnement de notre législation valaisanne.” After it was written, the document received numerous supplements, additions and commentaries, which were officially confirmed by the Diet of Valais in its final report. A comprehensive revision was not carried out until 1780. This “cantonal” law remained in force for 200 years, until the difficult phase during the transition from the 18th to the 19th century, a sign of its unusual permanence.

"Sion/Sitten, Médiathèque Valais, RIKB 8",Paper · I + 382 + I ff. · 21 x 29 cm · 1433,"This Latin Bible contains the Books of the Old Testament (Octateuch, Kings, Chronicles, Ezra, Tobit, Judith, Esther, Job and Maccabees). They are preceded by Jerome's prologue to the whole of the Bible (in logical order: ff. 11, then 13-14r; the beginning is incomplete), by an excerpt from De doctrina christiana 2, 8-9 by Saint Augustine (f. 14) and by Jerome's prologue to the Pentateuch (in the order: f. 14v then f. 9). Several leaves at the beginning have been lost or were not bound correctly; the manuscript currently begins with Genesis 19.26. The incomplete text of Genesis should be read in this order: ff. 9v-10, 15-16, 12 (Gn 10.30-19.26 are missing), 1-8 (Gn 31.28-36.19 are missing), 17-26r. Similarly there are defects at the end of the manuscript: the text is interrupted on f. 379v at 2 Maccabees 14.6. There are several errors in the modern foliation: 3 leaves between ff. 161 and 162 were not counted; the foliation jumps from f. 188 to f. 190, and there is a f. 256a. RIKB 8 has a blue initial with red pen flourishes (f. 9v), as well as several simple initials in red, in part with geometrical motifs (e.g. on ff. 69r or 112r). As we learn from the explicit on f. 227v, this manuscript was transcribed in 1433. It belonged to the Swiss entrepreneur Kurt Bösch (*1907 in Augsburg - † 2000 in Augsburg), bibliophile, collector and patron of the arts, who notably founded l‘Institut Universitaire Kurt Bösch (IUKB) in Brämis/Sion (VS). In 2012, the UIKB donated several valuable books, including this manuscript, to the Médiathèque Valais.

The first part, printed around 1475 by Michael Wenssler in Basel (GW 7890), contains the Speculum sapientiae, which had erroneously been attributed to the holy bishop Cyril. This collection of 95 fables in Latin prose was probably compiled around 1337-1347 by the Italian Dominican Bongiovanni da Messina. The second part contains Aesop's fables in a Latin version in verse called “Fables by Anonymus Neveleti“ (after the name of the first publisher, Isaac Nicolas Nevelet, in the year 1610), which eventually were attributed to Gualterus Anglicus (12th century). This second, handwritten part was produced around 1474 by Georg Supersaxo's anonymous scribe. It is comparable to other copies that were produced for Georg Supersaxo around 1472-1474, at the time that the young man studied law in Basel. This group of manuscripts includes the classical writers (Terence, Sallust …) as well as texts known only to scholars (Augustinus Datus, Gasparinus Barzizius …).

The first part, printed around 1472 by Michael Wenssler and Friedrich Biel in Basel (GW 3676), contains the Epistolae by the humanist and professor of rhetoric Gasparino Barzizza from Bergamo (ca. 1360-1431). This is followed by The Consolation of Philosophy by Boethius, also from the workshop of Michael Wenssler in Basel from about 1473-1474 (GW 4514). Next is the first handwritten text (incomplete, with marginal and interlinear glosses), Jesuida seu De passione Christi by the humanist and physician Girolamo della Valle from Padua († ca. 1458 or 1494). This work, written in hexameter and dedicated to Pietro Donato, Bishop of Padua from 1428 until 1447, was most likely copied from the edition of about 1474 that was printed by Michael Wenssler in Basel (GW M49385) and that also served as model for the lay-out. The fourth part contains the  Catiline conspiracy by Sallust. At the end of the volume, the fifth part is made up of three works by two authors (with marginal and interlinear glosses; initials in red and green); due to a bookbinder's error, the order of the quires is mixed up. This fifth part contains the Elegantiolae (the order for reading would be: ff. 1r-10v, 27r-38v, 11r-20r) by the humanist and professor of rhetoric Agostino Dati from Siena (*1420 or 1428, †1478), as well as two treatises by Gasparino Barzizza, which are already included in the printed part, the Praeceptorum summula (ff. 20r-21v) and the Modus orandi (ff. 21v-26v, 39r-43r). The three handwritten parts of the volume were produced by different hands, among them that of the anonymous scribe of Georg Supersaxo. S 56 therefore is comparable to the other manuscripts (S 51, S 101, S 105) that were made for Georg Supersaxo at the time when the young man studied law in Basel (around 1472-1474).

Numerous handwritten copies make it possible to distinguish three different versions of the French text, which gave rise to translations into Latin and into the vernacular languages. The oldest German translation, going back to about 1393-1399, is by Michel Velser, a member of the von Völs family (Völs, South Tyrol). This copy, S 94 from the library of Walter Supersaxo (ca. 1402-1482), Bishop of Sion, and of his son Georges (ca. 1450-1529), contains numerous ornamental initials, some zoomorphic or anthropomorphic. The endpapers are parchment. Based on the language, the manuscript should be from Northern Switzerland. An ownership note on f. 120v mentions an uncle “G”, which may suggest Georges Supersaxo himself. In the binding, there was a fragment of a papal document that can without doubt be dated to the middle of the 13th century, from a Pope Innocent and addressed to the Abbot of Kempten. Ms. S 94 can be compared to another manuscript from the Supersaxo library, namely with S 99, which contains a French version of the Voyages.

"Sion/Sitten, Médiathèque Valais, S 95",Paper · 77 ff. · 21 x 29 cm · Valais · 16th century,"This manuscript from the library of Walter Supersaxo (ca. 1402-1482), Bishop of Sion, and of his son Georg (ca. 1450-1529) is bound in a piece of parchment and is divided into several parts. The main part (ff. 2r-43r) is devoted to the statutes of Valais (Statuten der Landschaft Wallis). They are preceded by a table of contents in a version that is similar to the statutes (Landrecht) of 1511-1514 by the Bishop of Sion and Cardinal Mathieu Schiner, but with a different order of the articles and with important modifications and additions. On ff. 65r-69v, the same scribe copied the statutes (Kürzerung des Rechten) promulgated in 1525, notably by Georg Supersaxo, and confirmed in 1550. This manuscript from the Supersaxo library therefore is merely a preliminary version of the Statuta of 1571. Only the manuscript from 1571, which is in the State Archives of Valais (AV 62/4) and which also exists in a German and a French version, became the normative base reference up until the promulgation of the Civil Code of Valais in 1852. Between these two versions of the statutes, on ff. 51r-54v, is the testament of Johannes Grölin (Groely), citizen and former castellan of Sion (civis et olim castellani dominorum civium Sedunensium); the document is written by the notary Martin Guntern (1538-1588) on 8 January 1585 in Sion. Various notes from the years 1557-1590 are found at the beginning and end of the manuscript (on the front pastedown and f. 1; on ff. 70v-77v and on the back pastedown). They are fragments of accounts and of jobs in several hands, among them that of Martin Guntern, together with notes relating to the birth of the children of Bartholomäus Supersaxo (†1591), the grandson of Georg Supersaxo. Martin Guntern was not only a notary, he was also an important political figure (especially state secretary from 1570 until his death), who played an important role in the writing and translation of the Statutes of Valais of 1571. Bartholomäus Supersaxo, who in 1565 left behind a note of ownership on the front pastedown of S 95, was governor of Monthey (1565-1567), chaplain of Sion (1574) and Vize-Vogt - vice-reeve - (1579-1585); in 1573, he married his second wife, Juliana, daughter of Johannes Groely.

The first (ff. 1r-126r) is a treatise on the Inquisition, written in Girona in 1359 by the Catalan Dominican Nicolau Eymeric, Grand Inquisitor of Aragon (before 1320-1399). The version in S 97 contains the chapter De suspicione (beginning on f. 104v), which is sometimes considered a separate work; the table of contents was written on parchment (f. 1). In the second part of the manuscript (ff. 132r-214r), there is a version of the Gesta Romanorum in 31 chapters, a famous collection of fables and moralizing tales that was probably written in Germany or England before 1342.

The major part of the manuscript (ff. 1r-122r; initial in red, yellow and black on f. 1r) is taken up by Pontus and Sidonia, a work that experienced great success in the 15th and 16th century. This prose version of the Anglo-Norman romance Horn, sometimes attributed to Geoffroy de la Tour Landry, was written towards the end of the 14th century or the beginning of the 15th century in France. It is followed by two texts by Alain Chartier (*1385-1395, †1430), secretary and ambassador for the kings Charles VI and especially Charles VII: on ff. 122r-131r is the famous Bréviaire des nobles (ca. 1422-1426) and on ff. 131r-136v is the Lay de paix (ca. 1424-1426).

This codex is part of a group of manuscripts (S 51, S 56, S 105) that Georg Supersaxo himself made or had made during his studies in Basel (beginning in 1472). In this group, Terence's comedies are contained in the present manuscript as well as in codex S 105. These two manuscripts are very similar to one another regarding text and formatting. However, in contrast to codex S 105, which is written carefully and regularly and which is decorated with more elaborate initials, codex S 101 definitely is a manuscript for regular use. The initials and the rubrication soon discontinue. The binding is from the same workshop as that of codex S 51.

"Sion/Sitten, Médiathèque Valais, S 102",Parchment · 125 + VI ff. · 22 x 35 cm · Bologna · middle of the 14th century,"This manuscript from the library of Walter Supersaxo (ca. 1402-1482), Bishop of Sion, and of his son Georg (ca. 1450-1529), with initials in red and blue (some with pen-flourish initials, e.g. on ff. 1r and 113v; two drawings on ff. 77r and 91r), contains eight legal treatises in Latin, half of them anonymous: 1.  Johannes de Blanasco, (Libellus super titulo) de actionibus (ff. 1r-45r); 2.  Aegidius de Fuscarariis, Ordo judiciarius (ff. 46r-67v); 3.  Ordo judiciarius “De edendo“ (ff. 68r-69v; incomplete); 4. Ordo judiciarius “Scientiam“ (ff. 69v-75v); 5. Tancred of Bologna, Ordo judiciarius (ff. 77r-113v); 6. Contentio actoris et rei (ff. 113v-117r); 7. Parvus ordo judiciarius (ff. 117r-121v); 8. [Tancred of Bologna / Raymond of Penyafort], Summa de matrimonio (ff. 121v-125v; incomplete). Johannes de Blanosco († ca. 1281 or later) from Burgundy studied and probably also taught law in Bologna before returning home and placing himself in the service of Duke Hugo IV of Burgundy. In 1256, perhaps when he was still in Bologna, he wrote his commentary on the Institutes “De actionibus“. The author of the second treatise in this manuscript, Aegidius de Fuscarariis (†1289), was the first lay teacher for canon law at the University of Bologna. His Ordo judiciarius from 1263-1266 is his most important work. Tancred of Bologna (ca. 1185-ca. 1236), the author of texts 5 and 8, was a renowned canonist and archdeacon, who associated with Popes Innocent III, Honorius III and Gregory IX; among his works, the Summa de sponsalibus et matrimonio, written around 1210-1214 and revised by Raymond of Penyafort in 1235, enjoyed some success. But he became famous through his Ordo judiciarius (ca. 1214-1216), which established itself throughout Europe as the reference work for legal procedure. Regarding the four anonymous (or not-securely attributed) treatises of manuscript S 102: number 3, better known by the title Ulpianus de edendo, was probably created in England in 1140-1170; number 4 prior to 1234 in France (its author is a certain Gualterus, perhaps identical to Gauthier Cornu, Archbishop of Sens); number 6, from the time of the papacy of Gregory IX, may be of Anglo-Norman origin; and finally number 7, which was written in the North of France in two versions in 1221 and 1238. The Supersaxo library contains numerous legal works. S 102 can best be compared with manuscript S 104 (Goffredus Tranensis, Summa super titulis Decretalium), which likewise is a 14th century work from Bologna.

This printed work contains the Universal Chronicle by Eusebius of Caesarea and its continuation by the Church Father Jerome, the Universal Chronicle by Prosper of Aquitaine, the historiographic work De temporibus by the Florentine Matteo Palmieri (1406−1475), the short Chronica by Cassiodorus, and the Chronicon by Herman the Cripple. The printed part is preceded (on Fol. Av) by a handwritten computistic-calendric table for the years 1501 to 1540 by the scholar Aegidius Tschudi (1505−1572) of Glarus. The second, handwritten part of the volume contains a copy of the text of the first four parts of the history of the monastery of St. Gall, the Casus sancti Galli. Aegidius Tschudi had his collaborator Franciscus Cervinus of Schlettstadt, who had a humanist university education, copy the historiographic works of the St. Gall monks Ratpert (pp. 1−37) and Ekkehart IV (pp. 38−253), the abbey chronicle of those who anonymously continued it for the years 975 to 1203 (pp. 255-305), as well as the continuation by Conradus de Fabaria about the fate of the abbey between 1203 and 1234 (pp. 307-367). The printed as well as the handwritten parts contain numerous marginal notes in Tschudi's hand. The volume was owned by Tschudi (Sum Aegidii Schudi Claronensis; ownership note on the front inside cover); as part of Tschudi's book collection, this volume was sold to St. Gall Abbey in 1768 by his heirs.

It contains “Parzival” (pp. 5−288; version D) by Wolfram von Eschenbach, the Song of the Nibelungs (pp. 291−416; version B) with the following lament (pp. 416−451; version B), the poem “Karl der Grosse” (pp. 452−558; version C) by der Stricker, the verse narrative “Willehalm” (pp. 561−691; version G) by Wolfram von Eschenbach, as well as five sung gnomic verses by Friedrich von Sonnenburg (p. 693; version G). Until 1768, when the manuscript was purchased by the Monastery of St. Gall, this volume certainly also contained fragments of the epic poems “Die Kindheit Jesu” by Konrad von Fussesbrunnen and Unser vrouwen hinvart by Konrad von Heimesfurt. These two works were removed from the manuscript of epic poems before 1820 and are now held in the Staatsbibliothek Preussischer Kulturbesitz in Berlin (mgf 1021) and the Badische Landesbibliothek in Karlsruhe (Cod. K 2037), respectively. The manuscript, illustrated with 78 uniformly executed initials by unknown artists from the miniature painting school of Padua, was commissioned by a wealthy client who was interested in Middle High German epic poems. The first owner known by name was the Swiss polymath and universal scholar Aegidius Tschudi (1505−1572) from Glarus, whose estate of manuscripts the Monastery of St. Gall was able to acquire in 1768.

"St. Gallen, Stiftsbibliothek, Cod.

It begins with a treatise on simony, in Latin and German, which was written by ‘brůder Johannes' and dedicated to ‘der erwurdigen frowen von Mulhein', presumably Veronica von Mülheim, who was abbess of the convent from December 1504 until her death in May 1508. Johannes may have been a monk from Tennenbach, the Cistercian monastery which had responsibility for the cura animarum of the nuns. The rest of the manuscript contains a number of translations of normative texts from the Cistercian order, including the Liber definitionum and the Ecclesiastica Officia. Their use for nuns is highlighted by the German translations and the inclusion of only relevant chapters. Many of these were also transmitted in the Cistercian nuns' convent of Lichtenthal, near Baden-Baden. Although the convent was never formally reformed, the manuscript points to reforming impulses in the early part of the sixteenth century. The manuscript was bought in 1782 by the St. Gall monk Gall Metzler (1743-1820), parish priest in Ebringen near Freiburg, which was owned by St. Gall.

It was dedicated to the convent's abbess, Maria Störin von Störenberg. Following a prologue by Lorichius on the usefulness of liturgical ceremonies, the author provides the nuns with German translations of two of the founding texts of the Cistercian order from the twelfth century: the Exordium Cistercii, a narrative of the early history of the order, and the Ecclesiastica Officia, a set of regulations for liturgical and monastic life. It concludes with a short justification of why Cistercians pray the Seven Penitential Psalms on a Friday. A set of statutes (the Usus Conversorum) for lay brothers, translated into German, is appended.

According to Metzler's statement on p. 1, he copied a codex from Bobbio written in Irish script (ex manuscripto codice monasterii Bobiensis, litteris Hibernicis confecto) ; however, this codex has not survived until today. Metzler might have produced the copy in 1611 during a stay at Bobbio on one of his travels to Rome. This manuscript is the only textual witness for Columbanus' letters I-V. It is conceivable that Metzler's copy is based on the same codex as Patrick Fleming's posthumously published (Collectanea sacra, Löwen 1667 ; in 1623, Fleming copied two manuscripts from Bobbio that have also been lost.)

On p. 10, the St. Gall abbot, dressed in a simple monk's habit, kneels with Mary and John beneath the Cross of Christ.

In the first part (fol. 6r−21r), Bloch introduces the institution of the lay brothers. He describes the residences of the lay brothers or conversi over the centuries, he discusses their tasks and duties and their conduct with respect to worldly goods, and he describes their seal. In the second part he recounts, in chronological order, important episodes and stories about the lay brothers from the 15th century to the year 1793 (fol. 22r−79v). A third part lists the names of all the lay brothers who were part of the community from the abbacy of Eglolf Blarer (1426−1442) until 1793 (fol. 89r−101r). Between parts 2 and 3 the author inserted, like a transcript and written by another hand, serious exhortations by Prince-Abbot Beda Angehrn (1767−1796) to the lay brothers from the year 1775 (fol. 80r−83v). Because of several problems, the St. Gall abbot had called all the lay brothers to him. The manuscript's frontispiece (fol. 4v) shows a lay brother in 16th century garb.

The monastery community dedicated it to the dean on the occasion of the golden jubilee of his ordination to the priesthood on 16 October 1766. Three poems, odes and eulogies each praise Fr. Aegidius Hartmann as minister of the sacraments, as pastor and as priest celebrating this jubilee. Each poem is preceded by an emblem of a flower in a garden; the three sections each begin with a wreath of three flowers. The Festschrift was drawn and probably also written by Fr. Dominikus Feustlin (who also wrote the four-volume antiphonary Cod. Sang. 1762, 1763, 1764 and 1795). At the end of the manuscript, two small-format booklets contain texts honoring Abbot Beda Angehrn. He received the first of these, titled Duplicis piique voti unanimis consensio, in 1778 from students in Kreuzlingen. The second, titled Alte und neue Dichtkunst. Ein Tafelgesang, was also presented in 1778 by the Imperial Abbey Petershausen in Constance.

Volumes 2 to 6 of the Sacrarium have the shelfmarks Cod. Sang. 1719−1723. This volume lists the cult objects such as chalices, statues, monstrances, candle holders, small altars, patens, censers, reliquaries, etc. that made up the church treasure of the Monastery of St. Gall in the year 1693. This overview, compiled and written by Father Gregor Schnyder (1642-1708) and dedicated to the Prince-Abbot of St. Gall Cölestin Sfondrati (1687−1696), includes historical information about the individual cult objects and illustrates these objects with 60 realistic images in opaque colors. This register is of great importance today since many of the objects were lost, were seized or were melted down during the military invasions by troops from Zurich and Bern in 1712, by the French in May 1789, through the secularization of the monastery in 1805 and the following liquidation of a great part of the abbey's property. Various works by renowned gold- and silversmiths of the early modern period (including Hans Jacob Bayr, Augsburg; Heinrich Domeisen, Rapperswil; Fidel Ramsperg, Appenzell; Johannes Renner, Wil) can be reconstructed only through this Hierogazophylacium (German: Heiligschatzbehälter, ‘container of holy treasure).

In his compilation Fr. Gregor Schnyder paid special attention to the relics contained in the various objects; he noted their origin and copied certificates about their authenticity. This volume is introduced by a frontispiece in shades of brown (fol.

The Office of the Dead (fol. 69r-98v), including Vespers, Vigil, and prayers for the anniversaries of the deaths of priests, abbots and other deceased persons, is followed by prayers of indulgence (fol. 99r-111v). The beginning of the Office of the Virgin as well as possibly a calendar preceding it have been lost. The fact that the patron saints of St. Gall, St. Gall and St. Othmar (fol. 56r-56v; fol. 58r-58v), are the only saints mentioned other than Mary and St. Benedict suggests a provenience from the Monastery of St. Gall. The manuscript is written in Gothic script; it is decorated with numerous initials executed in gold leaf and with colorful vine scrolls in the margins of individual pages. The beginning of the Office of the Dead (fol. 69r) is adorned with a small miniature of a catafalque bordered by two Benedictine monks, one of which is holding a prayer book in his hands. The cut leather binding with the monogram S, created by a master whose name is unknown, is particularly noteworthy. The covers show the two Princes of the Apostles, Peter (front cover, with book and key) and Paul (back cover, with book and sword), surrounded by rich vine scroll ornamentation. The Abbey Library of St. Gall was able to acquire this manuscript in June 2006 at a Christie's auction in New York from the collection of the American brewer Cornelius J. Hauck (1893−1967) from Cincinnati (Ex Libris on the inside front cover).

Notker Grögle) · 1774,"This vesperal in a distinguished binding was commissioned by Prince-Abbot Beda Angehrn (1767−1796); it was written in 1774 by Joseph Adam Bürke (chronogram with the name of the scribe on p. 92), an alumnus of the Gymnasium (preparatory school) of Neu St. Johann that was led by St. Gall monks, and richly illustrated by Father Notker Grögle (1740−1816). The volume contains the incipits of the chants for Vespers (antiphons and hymns), written in German plainsong notation (“Hufnagelnotation”) on five lines, for the feasts of Jesus Christ and of the saints for the entire liturgical year. It is divided into the parts Proprium de tempore (pp. 1−36), Proprium sanctorum (pp. 37−80) and Commune sanctorum (pp. 81−92). This manuscript was held in the choir library of St. Gallen Cathedral until 1989. Then it was transferred to the archives of the cathedral parish of St. Gall, and in 2014 it came to the Abbey Library of St. Gall. The volume, which consisted of 96 pages in 1774, was certainly used for the liturgy in the Cathedral of St. Gall until the 1930s. The mostly handwritten additions and supplements (after p. 97) date from the 19th century. Also glued and bound into the volume are texts from unspecified printed liturgical publications of the 19th and early 20th century. Noteworthy among the illustrations is the oldest pictorial depiction to date of the newly built “Gallusmünster”, today the Cathedral of St. Gall (p. 72). On the flyleaf is the finely drawn coat of arms of Prince-Abbot Beda Angehrn.

According to a note of ownership (f. 467v) dated 1367 (?), this Hebrew Bible was probably owned by David ha-Cohen Coutinho, member of a family of Portuguese marranos. In the 15th century, it was the property of Moses Abulafia, until his widow sold it, as shown by the sales contract, dated and signed in 1526 in Thessaloniki and placed in the beginning of the book (f. Ir). In the 16th century, the Bible was owned by the Talmudist and Rabbi Abraham di Boton of Thessaloniki (f. 467v). Thereafter its presence is attested in the Zaradel Synagogue of Alexandria in the 19th century (R. Gottheil, „Some Hebrew Manuscripts in Cairo“ in: Jewish Quarterly Review 17, 1905, p. 648). After the Bible entered the fine arts market, it has been in a private collection since 1996.

Additional poems are by a variety of poets, some by writers of the Hebrew Golden Age in medieval Spain, others by local authors, such as Elieser de Mordo. This manuscript is of great significance due to a cycle of sixty full-page illustrations from the Book of Genesis, executed in gouache. The illustrations are accompanied by Hebrew inscriptions, usually biblical verses identifying the scenes. They are the work of an artist, probably trained in Venice, who added his monogram in different variants (MC or M.C. MF.) to almost all of the illustrations. The left to right sequence of the pages suggests that a Christian artist must have first created the illustrations, and that the Hebrew texts were added afterwards. This manuscript from the first half of the 18th century, created on the island of Corfu, may have been a bridal gift from a member of the de Mordo family, a family which played an important role on the island at a time when the Venetian rule had to be defended against Ottoman attacks.

After becoming popular in France, the SeMaK quickly reached Germany, where it was recognized as an authoritative halakhic work. This manuscript, B115, is the latest of the three manuscripts in the Braginsky Collection (also B240 and B182), exemplifying the complex diffusion of the SeMaK in Germany. The glosses are the work of Moses of Zurich, who lived in Zurich in the middle of the fourteenth century. Consequently, manuscripts containing Moses' glosses are called the Zürcher. Often comments and glosses in the form of rectangular shaped “windows” were added in the margins or in the text itself, producing aesthetically pleasing and imaginative page layouts.

This gave rise to the name Yom Kippur Katan (""Minor Day of Atonement""). The new custom spread to Italy and finally on to Northern Europe.
Similar collections of prayers were particularly popular in the 18th century. In contrast to many others, this exemplar is decorated with an illustrated title page. If Judah Leib ben Meir of Glogau had not identified himself as scribe on this title page, it would probably be assumed to be the work of Aaron Wolf Herlingen of Gewitsch, since the style and the script correspond to his. For the time being, one can only speculate about the connection between Herlingen and the actual scribe Meir.

"Zürich, Braginsky Collection, B251",Parchment · 81 ff. · 18.7 x 13.7 cm · [Italy] · [14th/15th century],"The Spanish kabbalist Abraham Abulafia (1240- after 1291) advocated a concept of Kabbalah that had little or nothing to do with the well-known schools of thought. He considered Kabbalah neither as a form of gnosis nor as a kind of theosophical theory that concentrates on the Sefirot, the emanation of the Divine Being. Instead he attempted to attain a state of prophetic-mystical ecstasy, based on his conviction that the experience of the prophets was an ecstatic experience and that all true mystics were prophets. This work of his was especially popular and circulated under the titles Hayyei ha-Olam ha-Ba (""Life of the World to Come""), Sefer ha-Shem (""Book of the Divine Name"") or Sefer ha-Iggulim (""Book of Circles""); in this manuscript, however, it is called Sefer ha-Shem ha-Meforash (""Book of the Ineffable name""). The manuscript presents ten inscriptions in concentric circles in red and black ink, as well as 128 only in black ink. They contain detailed instructions for mystical meditation. While contemplating these circles, one should recite the 72-lettered name of God, which is arrived at by combining the numerical values of the letters in the names of the twelve tribes of Israel, of the Patriarchs, and the nine letters of the words shivtei yisra'el (""the tribes of Irasel"").

The Sefer Mitzvot Gadol (abbreviated the SeMaG) became a major and accepted source of halakhic rulings. It was frequently quoted and abridged; many commentaries were composed on it. The manuscript was copied by Hayyim ben Meir ha-Levi in 1288, possibly in Sierre, (Switzerland).

By using three different types of writing, he clearly distinguishes three types of texts: the Hebrew text of the Haggadah, the classical Hebrew commentary by Simeon ben Zemach Duran (1361-1444), and a German translation in Hebrew letters by  Wolf Heidenheim (1757-1832). The iconographic program of the Elieser Sussmann Meseritsch Haggadah  is very unusual. The title page presents an architectural design of triumphal arches, where various ornamental motifs in classicist style are creatively joined together. The first four (5v-7r) of seven illustrated scenes show the four sons mentioned in the Haggadah, with one illustration dedicated to each of them; the one for the son who does not know to ask is particularly original. The next two illustrations – the crossing of the Red Sea (12r) and King David with the harp (15v) – are rather conventional.

As the holiday marks the Giving of the Law, mystical traditions asserted that on this day Moses, as the matchmaker, brought the Jewish people (the bridegroom) to Mount Sinai (the wedding place) to marry God or the Torah (the bride). While several versions of ketubot for Shavuot are known, the most popular in Sephardic communities has been the poetic text composed by the renowned mystic of Safed, Rabbi Israel Najara (1555?–1625?). Divided into three sections, the special text of this Braginsky Collection ketubah appears within an imposing wooden architectural setting, comprising three arches and a broken pediment, within which is a crowned Decalogue. The upper story employs a dynamic rhythm of decorative architectural elements. The entire structure resembles a typical Sephardic Torah ark (ehal) from the synagogues in Gibraltar.

Below each of these figures is a small vignette that chronicles the Purim story. It is unusual that the skillfully drawn figures that embellish this scroll are dressed in Ottoman-court clothing. The choice of this type of dress is intriguing, and perhaps the most cogent reason for this combination is that the scroll was produced for a member of a small, affluent community of Turkish Jews who, after 1718, were permitted to live and trade freely in Vienna, while still remaining subjects of the Sultan of Turkey.

Today it consists of four parts of various lengths, which can be combined into one four-meter-long roll. Painted on both sides of the parchment, it depicts 559 coats of arms, each shield decorated with a crest, of high and lower nobility from Northern Switzerland, Southern Germany and Western Austria. Names are given next to each shield. In addition there are 28 flags of German bishoprics and monasteries. The order of these four remaining parts, which consist of thirteen parchment leaves that were sewn together, is as follows: Part I (36.5 cm) contains the coats of arms of the bishoprics and monasteries on the verso side (Merz-Hegi numbering: I-XXVIII; the numbering in the original is from the 16th/17th century) and 22 noble coats of arms on the recto side (1-22). Parts 2 and 3 (255.5 cm) were still sewn together in 1930. Part 2, consisting of four parchment leaves, contains the coats of arms 23-104 and 108-114  on the recto side and the coats of arms 214-220, 224-308 on the verso side.

The missing fourth part should have contained another 109 coats of arms, which are known from a late 18th century copy of the roll. The armorial was probably created in Zurich or in the area of Lake Constance. It can be dated to the period between 1330 and 1345. The style of the workmanship is reminiscent of the famous Codex Manesse, a collection of poems in German with 137 miniatures, also created in Zurich, but somewhat older.

For February, there is St. Matthias and in the medallion at the top a man trimming a tree in order to obtain wood.

After the doge, the procurators held the highest office in the Serenissima; upon their election, they had capitularies drawn up, usually illuminated, containing their oath and the list of their “commissione,” i.e., of the specific tasks to which they committed themselves by their oath. This fragment follows 21 commissions of Venetian procurators from the 15th century; it is distinguished from the others by its illumination, which is attributed to a high-level Venetian master trained in the circle of Leonardo Bellini, and also by the rare depiction of the patron saint of not only the procurator, but also his wife.

Created around 1312 in the convent itself, it was probably illuminated in the area around Lake Constance. It contains more than 80 pen-flourish initials, more than 60 historiated initials and 5 I-initials, which consist of several historiated medallions. Several pieces of the last two I-initials, whose medallions were cut out and sold separately, are known today; they are dispersed among various museums and libraries. In addition to the initials, in the floral friezes there are represented numerous kneeling and praying Dominican nuns as well as other secular donors (e.g., 3v, 18v, 90r, 159v, 161r etc.). Until the 19th century, the gradual was in use in the convent; around 1820 it was ceded to an antiquarian book dealer in Konstanz, Franz Joseph Aloys Castell (1796-1844). After 1860 it was owned by the English collectors Sir William Amherst of Hackney and Sir Charles Dyson Perrins (1864-1958). Upon the death of the latter, his library was offered for sale through Sotheby's, and the manuscript was purchased by the Swiss Confederation with the support of the Gottfried Keller-Foundation and the Canton of Thurgau.

This paper manuscript from the second half of the 16th century probably replaces an older copy. On the inside of the cover are found the large coats of arms of Burkhart von Hallwil and his two wives Judith von Anwil and Margaretha von Löwenberg. Pp. 4-10 contain a late version of the poem Ring von Hallwil, a saga about the endangerment and saving of the inheritance of the Hallwils. On pp. 11-17 there follow texts about family history and then a second, older version of the poem Ring von Hallwil (pp. 19-21). After a number of empty pages, there are six empty crests (pp. 48-50), meant for the three brothers Thüring I von Hallwil († 1386) und Katharina von Wolfurt, Walter V († after 1370) and Herzlaude von Tengen, “Hemann” (Johannes IV, † 1386) and Anna vom Hus. On p. 51 there is a view of the ancestral home of the Hallwil family. It is followed by pictures of Caspar (p. 54) and Burkhart von Hallwil (p. 55), scenes from tournaments (pp. 56-59), and images relating to the Ring von Hallwil (pp. 60-66). At the end of the manuscript, there are more coats of arms of the Lords of Hallwil and their wives (pp. 68-96), the last ones only sketched out but not completed (pp. 97-118). The manuscript was donated to the Swiss National Museum in 1907 by Count Walther von Hallwil, the last occupant of the castle, and his wife Wilhelmine.

These laws have been commented on by two medieval rabbinical authorities, included in the manuscript. The first is Judah ben Benjamin ha-Rofe Anav of Rome (Rivevan, d. after 1280), whose commentary to the laws makes reference to customs practiced by the Jewish community of Rome, such as an important ruling taken by the elders of Rome in 1280 at the Bozzechi Synagogue, which has been edited in the description. The second author, whose work is partially copied in the manual, is the leading Talmud authority for the Jewish communities in 11th century North Africa and Spain, Isaac ben Jacob Alfasi (Rif, 1013-1103). The first three chapters of a commentary on the Babylonian Talmud tractate Ḥulin, taken from his magnum opus entitled the  Sefer ha-Halakhot, have been copied into this manual.

The commissioner of the manuscript must be sought in the area of Lake Constance, probably in the city of Constance, which was very important in the politics and church politics at the time of the interregnum. In 1817, Father Blasius Hauntinger purchased the manuscript from Melchior Kirchhofer in Schaffhausen for the Benedictine Rheinau Abbey; in 1863, the manuscript, along with the Rheinau Abbey Library, became part of the Cantonal Library (today Central Library) in Zurich.

The outer leaf of each quire (quinio) is parchment, while the remaining leaves are papyrus.

"[sine loco], codices restituti, Cod. 4 (Legendarium)",Parchment · 23 ff. · ca. 42 x 30.5 cm · Fulda · ca. 1156,"A total of 23 leaves of a Fulda Legendary that originally consisted of six volumes, commissioned in 1156 by Rugger, monk at Frauenberg Abbey in Fulda (1176-1177 abbot of Fulda as Rugger II). The main parts probably were written by Eberhard of Fulda; the book decoration as well is very reminiscent of the Codex Eberhardi (Marburg, Hessisches Staatsarchiv K 425 and K 426). Based on the numbering in the surviving indexes and at the beginning of the texts, the size of the collection can be projected to have been about 500 vitae and passions. Thus this work bears testimony to the efforts for not only the economic, but also the spiritual and cultural reform undertaken under Abbot Markward of Fulda (1150-1165); at the same time this work is the northernmost and probably the earliest of the surviving five- and six-volume 12th century legendaries from Southern Germany. Later it served as (indirect) model for the base stock of texts of the great Legendary of Böddeken, through which it remained influential for the Bollandists' Acta Sanctorum and on into the modern times. The monumental Fulda Legendary was still used in Fulda in the middle of the 16th century by Georg Witzel (1501-1573) for his Hagiologium seu de sanctis ecclesiae (Mainz 1541) as well as for his Chorus sanctorum omnium. Zwelff Bücher Historien Aller Heiligen Gottes (Köln 1554). Fragments from the 3rd, 4th and 6th volumes are preserved in Basel, Solothurn, Nuremberg and Stuttgart. This indicates that at least the 3rd (May-June) and 6th (November-December) volumes of the legendary reached Basel, where both evidently were used as manuscript waste around 1580.
